Assume Null Hypothesis as Ho: Independence of categorical variables (Athlete and Smoking not related).
Thus Alternate Hypothesis as Ha: Dependence of categorical variables (Athlete and Smoking is somewhat/significantly related)

As (p_value = 0.00038) < (Î± = 0.05); Reject Null Hypothesis i.e. Dependence among categorical variables Thus Athlete and Smoking is somewhat/significantly related.
